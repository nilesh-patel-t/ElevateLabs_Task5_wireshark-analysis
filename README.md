# 🦈 Cyber Security Internship - Task 5: Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for **Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark**. The task involved capturing live packet data, filtering it, and identifying key network protocols to demonstrate hands-on protocol awareness and packet analysis skills.

## 🎯 Deliverables Submitted

* **`task5_capture.pcap`**: The full packet capture file generated by Wireshark.
* **`README.md`**: This short report summarizing the findings, protocols identified, and methodology.
* **Screenshots**: Images demonstrating the Wireshark interface, capture process, and application of specific display filters (included in the repo).

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

* **Tool:** Wireshark
* **Environment:** Kali Linux Virtual Machine

## ⚙️ Methodology

1.  **Installation & Setup:** Confirmed Wireshark was installed and ready.
2.  **Capture Start:** Started capturing on the active network interface (`eth0`) within the Kali Linux VM.
3.  **Traffic Generation:** Generated traffic by:
    * Running the `ping` command (to generate **ICMP** and **DNS** traffic).
    * Browsing a simple website (to generate **TCP** and **HTTP** traffic).
4.  **Capture Stop:** Stopped the capture after approximately one minute to gather sufficient data.
5.  **Filtering & Analysis:** Applied various display filters to isolate and identify the different protocols present in the capture.
6.  **Export:** Saved the complete session as a `.pcap` file.

## 🔎 Protocol Analysis & Findings

The analysis successfully identified more than the required three protocols. The following key protocols were confirmed in the capture:

| Protocol | Display Filter Used | Function/Purpose | Key Observation in Packets |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ICMP** | `icmp` | Internet Control Message Protocol. Used for network diagnostics, error reporting, and the `ping` utility. | Showed **Echo Request** and **Echo Reply** packets confirming connectivity. |
| **TCP** | `tcp` or `tcp.flags.syn == 1` | Transmission Control Protocol. A reliable, connection-oriented protocol crucial for web and application data transfer. | Showed **SYN** flags in packets, confirming the start of the three-way handshake connection establishment. |
| **DNS** | `dns` | Domain Name System. Translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses. | Showed **Standard Query** packets sent from the host and **Response** packets received with the resolved IP. |
| **ARP** | `arp` | Address Resolution Protocol. Maps an IP address to a physical MAC address on a local network segment. | Showed **ARP requests** broadcast by the VM to locate the MAC address of the default gateway. |

## ⭐ Outcome

This task provided hands-on experience in using a professional packet analyzer (Wireshark) to capture and dissect network traffic, successfully demonstrating packet analysis skills and a clear understanding of fundamental network protocols like TCP, ICMP, DNS, and ARP.
